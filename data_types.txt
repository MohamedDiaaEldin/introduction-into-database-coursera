What are data types?
Every column in a table has a data type. These data types are defined by SQL or Structured Query Language. A data type defines the type of value that can be stored in a table column. 

For example, here are some of the data types that are available:

Numeric data types such as INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL. 

Date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, DATETIME. 

Character and string data types such as CHAR, VARCHAR. 

Binary data types such as BINARY, VARBINARY. 

Miscellaneous data types such as: 

Character Large Object (CLOB) for storing a large block of text in some form of text encoding.   

Binary Large Object (BLOB) for storing a collection of binary data such as images.
